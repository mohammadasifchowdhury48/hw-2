   <p>94% of all Anywheere Workers report stable or increased earnings since becoming a working traveler
    One year ago, we decided to launch our very first Anywhere Worker study to
    better understand this growing population of workers who are embracing
    remote jobs and embarking on epic travels around the world. This year, we
    decided to conduct our second edition of the study to shed light on the
    latest trends among all of the traveling workers out there. We surveyed 2,000
    Anywhere Workers and guess what? These free-spirited souls are racking up
    passport stamps like never before! They've upped their travel game, opting
    for longer adventures across the globe.
